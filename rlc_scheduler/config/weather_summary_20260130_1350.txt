KEY POINTS FOR TRADING DECISIONS:
- Corn Belt in the U.S.: Expect upper teens Fahrenheit, near or slightly below average rainfall not conducive to crop growth which may result in tightening supplies leading to higher prices and trading volume increase if dry conditions persist; monitor precipitation closely over coming weeks as significant moisture requirements for corn have been unmet.
- Wheat Belt: Cooler temperatures suggest a suitable climate, but with the need for adequate rainfall (inches) to prevent potential yield issues impacting wheat supplies and prices; watch regional reports closely due to variable weather patterns across states in this area affect crops differently.
- Delta/South Region: Warm temperatures may boost energy production from agricultural activities, but the lack of specific precipitation data could hinder crop health if no moisture is provided soon as these regions are currently dry; local farming reports to be monitored for any potential impacts on commodity supply.

SOUTH AMERICA:
- Brazil (Mato Grosso, Parana): Warm temperatures with some areas experiencing only light showers or none at all may stress crops due to less rainfall; the forecasted warmer climate and limited precipitation might worsen these conditions leading to tightening supplies. Keep an eye on crop health reports for indicators of supply changes in rice, soybeans which are predominantly grown herein impacts prices accordingly.
- Argentina (Buenos Aires): Expect the warm temperatures with localized rainfall patterns; Buenos Aires has received snow but other regions like Cordoba show warmer conditions that may affect overall harvests and supply levels for commodities sourced from these areas, monitoring market reactions to temperature variations in Argentina.
- Brazil: Noted dry trends suggest potential stress on crops leading towards crop tightening; Mato Grosso (rainier) regions contrast this with eastern Sao Paulo receiving up to .40 inches of rain around Santo which could mean better supplies from these areas, look for regional discrepancies in commodity availability and pricing.
- South America: Dry conditions exacsisin gripping southern Brazil leading towards a widening drought; however, increased rainfall is anticipated by February's end to provide some moisture relief westward/northwestward – be on the lookout for price adjustments in crop-export dependent markets upon improvement of weather conditions.

WATCH LIST:
- Brazilian far southern regions receiving up to .40 inches near Santo - potential impacts on rice and soybean crops, monitor pricing trends closely.
- Argentina (Buenos Aires) experiencing snowfall – assess how this affects winter wheat/barley harvests which could influence export volumes; keep an eye out for localized price movements due to temperature variations impacting agriculture therein and the broader supply chain dynamics in South America’s commodity markets.
- Scattered showers across Paraguay – observe if this yields any positive effects on crop production, which could slightly ease market tension; however, areas with lighter rain or no precipitation are still at risk of drought stress and may require further monitoring for potential supply impacts in the commodity markets.
- Increased evaporation risks due to warm conditions - particularly critical if temperatures continue without a corresponding rise in rainfall, which could exacerbate water shortages affecting both agricultural yields and subsequent market supplies – this dynamic may influence futures pricing across the region's commodities.
- Increased localized precipitation expected by early February - consider how relief from drier conditions might improve crop health in stressed areas, potentially providing a respite to supply tightness; however, consistent monitoring is still recommended as weather forecasts remain uncertain at this stage.
