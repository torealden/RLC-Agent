KEY POINTS FOR TRADE DECISIONS:
US CONDITIONS AS OF FEBRUARY 4, 2025
- Corn Belt: Expect temperatures in the mid to high 60s with moderate rainfall of about an inch; crops may benefit from this break.
- Wheat Belt (Great Plains): Cooler temps around low 50s, insufficient moisture despite recent showers. Risk for drought conditions without additional rain soon.
- Delta/South: Forecast suggests continued dryness with little to no precipitation; agricultural interests should prepare irrigation strategies or risk crop stress and lower yields.

SOUTH AMERICA WEATHER OVERVIEW AND IMPACT
- Brazil (Mato Grosso, Parana): Temperatures from the upper 70s to low 90s with light rain forecasted; beneficial for crops but no flooding expected.
- Argentina (Buenos Aires): Mixed conditions - relief rains are predicted in some areas while others face continued cold and potential crop damage near conflict zones. Temperatures remain cool around the region, ranging from mid to high 60s Fahrenheit with scattered light rain or snow showers.

WATCH LIST FOR TRADERS TO KEEP AN EYE ON:
- Argentina (Buenos Aires): Southeastern areas continue facing cold temperatures nearing the upper 60s, risk of further crop damage without significant precipitation or snow cover. Trading decisions may consider these conditions.
- Mato Grosso/Parana Brazil: A mix of warm and cooler weather with some localized flooding risks; watch for regional commodity market fluctuations due to potential impacts on crop yields.
