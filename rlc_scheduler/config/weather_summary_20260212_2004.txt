KEY POINTS FOR TRADE DECISIONS:
US CONDITIONS:
- Corn Belt: Temperatures are expected to be seasonally typical, with no specific values provided; however, an important decrease in precipitation is anticipated towards the end of next week which may impact crop moisture levels.
- Wheat Belt: Limited rainfall information available suggests potential drying trends that could stress crops if continued. Monitor conditions closely for any necessary irrigation needs or weather advisories.
- Delta/South: Temperatures likely remaining moderate to warm; increased precipitation earlier in the week with a forecasted decrease, providing temporary relief for agriculture followed by drying that could benefit crop maturity if it persists. Monitor drought conditions closely as they may worsen.

SOUTH AMERICA: 
- Brazil (Mato Grosso): Rainfall trends fluctuating with a decrease in rainfall leading into the week, which could impact soybean yields if prolonged. Temperatures remain to be determined but are expected seasonally typical.
- Argentina (Buenos Aires, Cordoba regions): Significant increase followed by decreasing precipitation might indicate some flooding concerns; potential for drought relief in certain areas with further rainfall needed elsewhere.

WATCH LIST:
- Monitor the Delta region of the U.S. closely due to a temporary drying trend that could benefit crops before becoming unfavorable again, especially midweek if conditions do not improve towards precipitation return.
- Watch for continued rainfall in southeastern Brazil and Uruguay's forecasted thunderstorm risk which may affect agricultural productivity. Potential impact on the corn belt due to drying trends needs close monitoring. Temperature ranges are unspecified, so focus primarily on precipitation patterns.
