**Weather Briefing for Grain Traders - Feb. 20th to February 25th, U.S./Latin America Combined Overview:**
- **US Conditions Summary**: 
   * Corn Belt (Texas Panhandle/central Oklahoma): Increased rainfall of approximately half an inch recently with a possible extension into the weekend which may alleviate some drought stress and benefit crop conditions, although further temperature details would be necessary to assess full impacts. 
   * Wheat Belt (Texas Panhandle/central Oklahoma): Rainfall has slightly decreased as forecasted trends suggest continuing dry spells that could exacerbate current water scarcity issues; no significant rainfall events expected in the coming days.
   * Delta and South: No detailed weather conditions provided, further data needed for precise impact assessment. 

- **South America Conditions Summary**: (with assumptions due to lack of specifics)
  * Brazil's Mato Grosso region experienced minor increases in rainfall which could improve the current drought situation and benefit crops like soybeans, but no temperature details given.
     Note that increased precipitation may not directly translate into cooler temperatures without additional data. 
   * Argentina (Buenos Aires/Cordoba): Cooler weather accompanied by a slight increase in rainfall could provide temporary relief to crops; however, specifics on temperature ranges are lacking for precise assessment.

**Watch List:**
 1. Temperature and precipitation trends across the Corn Belt and Southern U.S., with special attention given to Texas Panhandle/central Oklahoma as these may impact crop conditions significantly.
2. Precipitation patterns in Brazil's Mato Grosso, Parana states for potential improvements or continued stress on agriculture due to weather variability.
3. Weather forecasts and temperature predictions particularly focusing on Argentina (Buenos Aires/Cordoba) as these may provide short-term relief during the rainy season but also bring concerns about cold fronts affecting crops if temperatures drop significantly with rain.

---
For more precise data, refer to meteorological services such as NOAA or ECMWF and consider localized reports for detailed insights on sunshine duration, wind patterns etc.  
Remember that weather events impact grain prices differently based on their timing relative to crop growth stages.
No specific temperature readings are provided; hence forecasts should be used with caution in trading decisions until they become available. Decreased precipitation and potential dry spells could stress crops if no further rainfall occurs, but regions like Mato Grosso may see beneficial effects from the observed increases.

Note: Without specific temperature details or other weather events' data (cold fronts/warmings), sunny days vs. cloudy conditions etc.), this briefing offers general expectations based on precipitation trends only and should be supplemented with more localized information for informed trading decisions.

I hope this provides a clearer picture, but please feel free to reach out if you need further assistance or clarification!
