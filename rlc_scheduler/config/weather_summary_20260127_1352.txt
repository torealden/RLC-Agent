KEY POINTS FOR TRADING DECISIONS AND WEATHER IMPACT ON CROPS
US CONDITIONS:
- Corn Belt: Expect teens to mid-20s Fahrenheit temperatures, very low precipitation (less than half an inch), minimal impact on crops.
- Wheat Belt: Anticipate below 50°F with similar precipitation levels as corn belt; potential for frost damage due to cooler conditions affecting crop development positively. 
- Delta/South (Louisiana): Frost and freeze risks in the mid-teens, significant citrus harm expected.

SOUTH AMERICA:
- Brazil Mato Grosso: Above average temperatures ranging from 75°F to around the lower high 80s today through Saturday; up to 1.18 inches of rain received in some areas, good for easing crop stress.
- Parana and Rio Grande do Sul: Temperatures similar to Mato Grosso but with slight variations towards warmer or cooler ends of the spectrum;
- Cordoba (Entre Rios): Rainfall between 0.75"-1", minimal impact on crops; subsoil moisture levels expected to be good.

WATCH LIST: 
- Frost damage in Louisiana citrus groves and potential for extended freezes into early February that could affect crop viability (Louisiana)
- Light rains increasing throughout southern Brazil, particularly Mato Grosso with a focus on improving drought conditions without significant temperature changes.
