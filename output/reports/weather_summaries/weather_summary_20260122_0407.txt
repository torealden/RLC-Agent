**Email Summary for Grain Traders - January 21, 2026 Weather Update from Drew Lerner of World Weather:**

--- US WEATHER ---
- A cold front threatens winter crops in the central U.S., with potential damage risks to parts of Nebraska, Kansas, and areas east into Illinois and Indiana due to extreme lows reaching single digits.
- Expected snow on Friday may provide some protection for vulnerable crops by reducing their exposure time during bitter cold temperatures without rain or fresh snow accumulation. However, short term damage is still possible before the cover of snow improves conditions.

**KEY POINTS: TRADING CONSIDERATIONS**
- Monitor Midwest weather closely due to potential crop stress and market impacts from this cold wave; consider temporary hedging strategies for short term risk management. Continue watching the GFS model output as conditions evolve.

--- SOUTHERN AMERICA -- BRAZIL, ARGENTINA ---
- Brazil (Mato Grosso): Expect above average rains to continue next week; good moisture for soybeans but be wary of potential flood risks. Soybean selling may increase.
- Parana: No significant changes forecasted;
hold positions with caution due to variable conditions expected in the coming weeks, including possible frost damage.
- Buenos Aires & Cordoba (Argentina): Dry trend continues; soy sales steady but watch for sudden weather shifts that could affect plantings and yields. Consider this dry period a stable window if no further changes are anticipated.

**WATCH LIST: URGENT ITEMS TO MONITOR THIS WEEK IN THE US AND SOUTH AMERICA**
- Extreme cold temperatures in the central and northern states; potential for crop stress;
watching livestock welfare due to travel disruptions.
- Midwest snowstorm impacts on crops, particularly soybeans which could see some damage but may recover with timely precipitation patterns post-event.

--- REST OF THE WORLD --- No significant global weather events affecting grain markets tonight. Stay alert to developments in the U.S and South America for any opportunities or threats as they arise.
