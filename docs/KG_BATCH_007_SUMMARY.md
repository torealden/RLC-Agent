## Key Frameworks Extracted

### 1. Prospective Plantings Analytical Framework (CORE PRE-SEASON ENGINE)
Complete five-step methodology for the most volatile report day of the year. Step 1: Build independent acreage from insurance price ratios, input costs, farmer conversations. Step 2: Assess analyst range width as % of average — narrower range = HIGHER surprise probability (counterintuitive). Step 3: Identify which crop will surprise most (soy typically highest probability due to narrow range). Step 4: Assess compounding when both acreage AND stocks surprise same direction (rare, ~15% of years, causes limit moves). Step 5: Cascade adjustments through full balance sheet. Validated: 2021 both below → limit-up. 2022 record soy exceeded consensus. 2023 corn exceeded while soy fell short.

### 2. Revenue Protection Insurance Price Ratio → Acreage Allocation
The actual economic framework farmers use — NOT spot prices, NOT analyst narratives. Soy/corn ratio set during February RP insurance period. Below 2.3 = corn strongly favored. Above 2.5 = soy strongly favored. 2.3-2.5 = contested (other factors determine marginal acre). 2023: ratio fell from 2.42 to 2.32 → PP confirmed corn +2.4M, soy essentially flat. Market repeatedly ignores this in favor of narrative (fertilizer costs, RD demand) but ratio predicts better.

### 3. USDA Outlook Forum → May WASDE Pipeline
Complete analytical sequence from February through May. AOF provides first official new-crop balance sheets but uses October WASDE as starting point — meaning projections can be 4 months stale. 2021: long-term projections showed corn $3.65, actual was $5.45. Key value: compare AOF to own independent estimate to identify USDA blind spots. AOF yield is pure trendline — no weather adjustment. May WASDE is first report incorporating PP acreage + AOF demand framework.

### 4. Independent Balance Sheet Construction Methodology
The analytical core of the entire system. Build EVERY component independently rather than adjusting USDA. Supply: own acreage × own yield + beginning stocks + imports. Demand: exports (own trade flow model), crush/grind (NOPA/EIA data), feed (GCAUs), FSI (seasonal patterns), seed (planting × seeding rate). When own carryout diverges >5% from consensus, that IS the highest-conviction trade. Adjustment cascade: exports adjust first (most elastic), feed last (least controllable). Do NOT simply change carryout by production delta — demand responds to price changes.

### 5. Geopolitical Rapid Response Framework
When events like Ukraine invasion occur: immediately quantify supply displacement, identify substitution pathways, revise own balance sheets SAME DAY. Speed of independent analysis is maximum competitive advantage — HB revised within days, market took 2-3 weeks, USDA took until May WASDE. Ukraine 2022: wheat exports +150M bu, corn exports +400M bu, sunflower oil loss → soy oil demand surge. Divergence between own revised estimate and stale consensus IS the trade.

### 6. March 1 Quarterly Stocks Methodology
Halfway through marketing year. Second-quarter feed/residual implied by stocks minus known demand. Corn: second-quarter as % of marketing-year total, historical avg 27%. Below average suggests annual forecast too high. Soy: second-quarter residual typically -30 to -50M bu. When outside that range, flag for production revision (2021: cumulative residual suggested production 120M bu above USDA → yield revision potential → trendline adjustment).

## Architecture Status

**The knowledge graph now contains 110 nodes, 67 edges, and 42 contexts from 54 sources spanning 2020-2023.** The annual analytical cycle is fully covered from January through December with no remaining temporal gaps. The system captures both the WHAT (data points, reports, events) and the HOW (analytical frameworks, decision trees, cascade methodologies) that constitute professional commodity market analysis.

**Remaining enrichment priorities:**
1. Consulting engagement documents — granular, market-specific trade recommendations
2. Additional 2023-2024 reports — RD buildout era, 45Z tax credit impact
3. Canola oil and RIN forecast series — complete biofuel feedstock cycle
4. Any standalone methodology documents or training materials
