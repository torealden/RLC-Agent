## MAJOR NEW DOMAIN: Biomass-Based Diesel Market Infrastructure

This batch opens an entirely new analytical layer — the **downstream biofuel market** that connects agricultural commodity production to energy policy and credit markets. Prior batches covered agricultural supply/demand fundamentals. Batch 008 adds the demand-side infrastructure that explains WHY soybean oil, tallow, UCO, and DCO prices behave the way they do.

### 1. BBD Balance Sheet Model
Complete supply/demand framework for the combined biodiesel + renewable diesel market. Key finding: 2023 was a structural inflection point — RD crossed 50% of BBD production for the first time, combined capacity utilization fell below 70%, and BBD RIN generation exceeded the mandate by 75%. This overcapacity condition drives margin compression, BD capacity rationalization, and D4 RIN price pressure. The model tracks production (EIA monthly), capacity additions, mandate math (BBD + UAB = implied mandate), and oversupply ratios.

### 2. Feedstock Supply Chain Model
Complete global supply chain for fats, greases, and vegetable oils flowing into biofuel production. Key structural shifts documented: US became net importer of fats/greases for the first time in 2022. UCO imports exploded 3x in one year. China becoming primary UCO source (31%, growing to >50%). Tallow sourcing diversifying from 100% Canada to multi-country. Import CAGR 24% since 2012. Traceability concerns creating new industry (startups focused on UCO origin verification).

### 3. Feedstock Price Transmission Chain
South American oilseed production → CBOT SBO → cash SBO → yellow grease/UCO (2-4 week lag) → tallow (4-6 week lag) → DCO (ethanol grind economics). SBO is the marginal barrel and sets the floor. CI-adjusted LCFS credit value determines premium structure: UCO gets 7.25c/gal per $1 LCFS vs SBO at only 0.75c. This differential drives the UCO import surge and explains why traceability is an existential issue for the market.

### 4. RIN Oversupply / Nesting Mechanics
Complete RFS credit market mechanics. Nesting allows D4 RINs to satisfy both BBD and advanced mandates. UAB calculation methodology. D4/D6 spread as oversupply signal (<$0.05 = maximum oversupply). 2023: BBD exceeded mandate by 75% vs historical average of 33%. When oversupply ratio >1.3x, strong downward pressure on D4 values.

### 5. BBD Margin Analysis Framework
Revenue stack: fuel price + RIN value + LCFS credit (by CI score). Cost: feedstock mix (varies by producer type). BD mix: 75% SBO + 25% YG. RD mix: 50% BFT + 25% DCO + 25% UCO. Integrated BD producers (650M gal) are swing producers between BD production and SBO sales. Q2 2023 margins ranged from +84c to -39c — negative margin triggers capacity cuts with 4-8 week cycle time.

### 6. SAF Market Framework
Emerging market that competes with RD for same feedstocks and capacity. Federal $1.25-1.75/gal tax credit. Grand Challenge: 3B gal by 2030. EU ReFuelEU mandate: 2% in 2025, 6% in 2030, 70% in 2050. Key dynamic: SAF/RD capacity switching based on relative margins. DGD SAF plant and Montana Renewables Max SAF Case demonstrate this. SAF demand growth = additional feedstock demand = structural price support for fats/oils.

### 7. Soybean Crusher Feasibility Methodology
RLC Consulting engagement framework: Red Flag Report → Market Analysis → Supply Analysis → Demand Analysis → Crush Margin Forecasting → Competitive Landscape → Financial Analysis → Strategic Recommendations. Key metrics: 75-150 mile origination radius, $0.80-1.00/bu crush margin breakeven, 15% minimum pre-tax DCF-ROI, $0.05-0.15/bu basis impact from new 1,000 ton/day facility.

## Knowledge Architecture Status

**122 nodes, 75 edges, 46 contexts across 62 sources.**

The graph now spans TWO COMPLETE ANALYTICAL DOMAINS:

**Domain 1: Agricultural Supply Fundamentals** (Batches 001-007)
- Complete annual calendar from January through December
- Crop production forecasting (planting, growing, harvest)
- USDA report interpretation methodology
- Trade flow / Chinese demand
- Weather / ENSO
- Acreage allocation economics

**Domain 2: Biofuel Demand Infrastructure** (Batch 008)
- BBD market balance sheets (production, capacity, mandates)
- Feedstock supply chains (fats, greases, vegoils globally)
- Credit market mechanics (RFS RINs, LCFS, state programs)
- Margin analysis (BD vs RD, feedstock mix optimization)
- SAF as emerging demand competitor
- Crusher feasibility (connects agricultural supply to industrial demand)

**The two domains connect through soybean oil** — which is simultaneously an agricultural commodity (Domain 1) and a biofuel feedstock (Domain 2). The crush-for-oil thesis (Batch 003) is the bridge: when RD margins are positive, crush demand for soybeans rises not for meal but for oil, which feeds directly into the BBD balance sheet model.

## Remaining Enrichment Priorities
1. **CO (Canola Oil) quarterly reports** — still need to locate and process
2. **Additional Q2 2023 quarterlies** — Executive Summary (too large), Vegoil Summary (Joao), LCFS commentary
3. **Jake Biodiesel Articles** (Jul/Aug/Sep 2023) — weekly market intelligence
4. **Bob's RVO Analysis** — deep dive on 2023-2025 final RVOs
5. **Remaining OIC/consulting documents** — detailed engagement deliverables
