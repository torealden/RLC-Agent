## Report Structure Identified

**HB Weekly Report — Tore Section (2025 format):**

1. Executive Summary (commodity-by-commodity with weekly price changes)
2. Macro/Policy snapshot
3. Weather snapshot
4. "What's Next" watchlist (5-7 items)
5. Tables: CME Futures, Calendar Spreads & % Carry, International Futures
6. Commodity Deep Dives (Corn, Soybeans, Wheat) each containing:
   - WASDE Update interpretation
   - Futures & Spreads analysis
   - Funds & Positioning
   - Trade Flows & Export data
   - Cash & Basis
   - "So What?" synthesis paragraph
7. U.S. Cash Market & Basis (combined across commodities)

12. Synthesis & Outlook (base case + bullish triggers + bearish triggers + watchlist)

**[BREAK — Felipe/external content starts here]**

13. Ethanol for America Act (external article)
14. Various industry articles (Vietnam ethanol, USDA Land Value, farmer sentiment, regulatory, trade policy)

**[Then back to Tore's work:]**

15. Commodity Recommendation Pages (Corn, Wheat, Soybeans, Soybean Meal, Soybean Oil)

## Major New Framework Elements

### 1. Calendar Spread % of Full Carry — The Market Structure Indicator
This is a signature analytical tool. Every spread discussion includes the % of full carry calculated with explicit assumptions (7% interest + $0.05/bu/month storage). The interpretation framework: >75% = bearish (full storage incentive), 40-60% = watch for demand pull, inversion = supply emergency. This standardizes comparison across commodities and time.

**Confidence: Very High (used in every weekly, quantified consistently)**

### 2. The "Split Market" Dynamic
A defining framework for 2025 soybeans: processors bid aggressively on strong crush margins while exporters struggle against Brazil's FOB discount. The insight is that flat price understates domestic demand strength — "basis and spreads do the heavy lifting beneath the board." This is a more sophisticated version of the canola oil framework from Batch 001.

**Confidence: Very High (explicitly articulated in both reports)**

### 3. Cash Tells the Sharper Story
A core analytical philosophy: physical market signals (basis, processor bids, barge freight, export inspections) reveal real demand better than futures prices. This becomes especially critical during data vacuums (government shutdown) when official statistics are unavailable. During Oct 2025's 29-day shutdown, the reports relied entirely on physical flow indicators.

**Confidence: Very High (fundamental to the analytical approach)**

### 4. Specific Trade Recommendations with Price Triggers
The recommendation pages provide actionable trading frameworks: "Sell any contract above $4.75" (corn), "Roll Jan short to May and add above $10.75" (soybeans), "Sell if any contract breaches 55 cents" (soy oil). These combine fundamental direction with specific entry points.

**Confidence: High (consistent format, explicit price levels)**

### 5. Farmland Value Bubble Thesis
A macro structural view: cropland values are 3.7x above real agricultural value (Illinois: $9,850/acre vs $2,660 estimated real value). Government programs have broken the link between land values and productive returns. The floor, if prices decline, is the real agricultural value — potentially 60-70% below current levels.

**Confidence: High (quantified with specific examples, structural argument)**

### 6. Energy-Inflation Contrarian View
A distinctive macro position: stagflation fears are overblown because energy prices are disinflationary (crude at ~half May 2022 price). The 1970s comparison requires 1,100% oil increase — nothing like current conditions. Tariffs reduced inflation during the last trade war. Housing weakness further limits inflation risk.

**Confidence: High (explicitly argued with data, contrarian positioning)**

## Cross-References to Batch 001

Several edges from Batch 001 are **reinforced** by Batch 002:
- Crude oil → vegetable oil prices (now explicit for soybean oil, not just canola)
- HOBO spread → biodiesel economics (mentioned in soy oil recommendation factors)
- SRE → feedstock demand (listed as bearish factor for soy oil)
- Weather → crop production (now detailed for US, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Russia)

The **meal-oil ratio dynamic** is new and important: strong meal demand drives record crush, which produces oil as byproduct. This connects meal fundamentals to oil supply — a relationship that doesn't exist in the canola oil reports.

## What's Different From the CO/RIN Reports

The HB Weekly Reports show a dramatically broader analytical scope:
- **5 commodities** vs 1-2 in CO/RIN reports
- **Global trade flows** (Brazil, Argentina, China, Black Sea, EU) vs North America focus
- **Explicit price targets** and trading recommendations vs general market direction
- **Technical analysis** layered on fundamental view
- **Macro overlays** (dollar, crude, freight, policy) integrated throughout
- **Standardized framework** (% of carry, "So What?", base/bull/bear/watchlist)

The analytical DNA is the same (data → interpretation → action) but the HB reports are the full expression of the framework.

## Next Steps

1. Process more HB Weekly Reports across different seasons (planting, growing, harvest, winter)
2. Look for older HB reports to identify when the format changed
3. Track how recommendations evolve week-to-week (did the trades work?)
4. Search for other report series beyond CO, RIN, and HB
5. Begin cross-linking: canola oil edges should connect to soybean oil edges
