## Major New Framework Elements

### 1. The LCFS Price Ceiling Formula
This is the most quantitatively precise framework in the entire extraction so far. At any given LCFS credit price, you can calculate exactly how much UCO can trade above soybean oil: at $190/tonne, UCO can sustain a 9 cents/lb premium over SBO. DCO gets 6 cents above SBO. The implied UCO-DCO spread ceiling is 3 cents.

This breaks traditional vegetable oil substitution logic entirely. UCO is not priced as a cheap alternative — it's priced as a carbon credit generation tool. **The price driver is the credit market, not the oil market.**

**Confidence: Very High (quantified formula, consistent 2018-2022)**

### 2. The Biodiesel-to-Renewable-Diesel Structural Shift
The single most important structural thesis in the waste oil universe: RD producers will displace biodiesel producers for low CI feedstock supply. Biodiesel YG/UCO usage forecast to decline 60% over 5 years. This forces industry rationalization — smaller biodiesel plants shut down.

The mechanism is straightforward: RD plants can stack LCFS + RIN + BTC credits more efficiently, allowing them to outbid biodiesel producers. This is the same BTC/RIN dynamic identified in the RIN Forecast reports (Batch 001), but seen from the feedstock supply side.

**Confidence: Very High (core structural thesis, documented in balance sheet commentary)**

### 3. UCO Has "Greatest Low-Carbon Fungibility"
A distinctive claim: of ALL feedstocks globally, UCO has the highest carbon credit value across every major offset scheme (California LCFS, EU RED, etc.). This creates global competition for a relatively fixed supply. EU RED double-counting for waste feedstocks makes UCO especially valuable in Europe.

**Confidence: Very High (explicitly stated, underpins the entire pricing framework)**

### 4. Fixed Supply vs Elastic Demand = Price Asymmetry
UCO/YG supply is tied to food consumption and animal processing — it can't be "planted." But biofuel demand is elastic (capacity additions, policy changes). This inelastic supply / elastic demand creates sharp price adjustments when demand shifts. Combined with low speculative participation, prices tend to be sticky but abrupt when they move.

**Confidence: Very High (structural observation, validated by 2021-2022 price behavior)**

### 5. Relative Price Dual-Axis Framework
YG is tracked on two axes simultaneously: relative to corn (feed vs biofuel allocation) and relative to SBO (biofuel feedstock substitution). These two ratios together determine where YG flows. Below 260% of corn = strong feed pull. Below 60% of SBO = biodiesel substitution signal. Regional variation matters — always check Missouri River, Southeast, and West Coast separately.

**Confidence: High (quantified framework with 3-year averages, consistent application)**

## Cross-References to Prior Batches

**Reinforced from Batch 001 (Canola Oil/RIN):**
- LCFS → low CI feedstock demand (now quantified with specific credit values)
- BTC impact on biodiesel economics (same mechanism, waste oil perspective)
- SRE → demand destruction (affects both vegetable oil and waste oil feedstocks)
- Biodiesel feedstock substitution hierarchy (now includes YG, UCO, DCO)

**Reinforced from Batch 002 (HB Weekly):**
- Soybean oil → biofuel linkage (UCO/YG compete with SBO for same end use)
- Crude oil → biofuel economics (affects RD margins and thus feedstock demand)

**New cross-market link identified:**
- Canola oil and UCO both compete for low CI feedstock demand in California
- The LCFS credit price is the common driver for both premiums
- This creates a **canola oil ↔ UCO ↔ SBO triangular competition** for RD feedstock

## Report Series Inventory Update

| Series | Prefix | Date Range | Count (est) | Processed |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Canola Oil | CO - | 2020-2022 | ~100+ | 12 |
| RIN Forecast | RIN Forecast - | 2019+ | ~100+ | 8 |
| HigbyBarrett Weekly | HigbyBarrett... | 2025+ | ~30+ | 2 |
| YG/UCO | YG/UCO-YG | 2018-2022 | ~30+ | 13 |
| Wiesemeyer Policy | Wiesemeyer - | 2018-2019 | ~20+ | 0 (external) |
| **TOTAL** | | | **~280+** | **35** |

Still ~2,000+ documents to process as more sync from the original Reports folder.

## Next Steps

1. Process more canola oil reports (2021-2022 drought year = critical framework period)
2. Look for soybean oil specific reports (SBO - prefix?)
3. Search for palm oil, tallow, or other feedstock-specific series
4. Begin processing Wiesemeyer reports for policy framework (these are likely external contributed content — verify with Tore)
5. Start building cross-market edge connections between batches
