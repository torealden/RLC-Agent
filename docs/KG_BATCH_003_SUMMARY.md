## Breakthrough: The Crush-for-Oil Thesis (Nov 2021)

The highest-value extraction so far. A structural thesis for the entire soybean complex: when oil share sustainably exceeds ~50%, processors shift from crushing for meal to crushing for oil. This cascades through Argentine crush, US meal exports, global meat production, Chinese adaptation, and Brazilian acreage allocation. Written Nov 2021, validated through 2025.

## Other Key Frameworks

- **Quarterly Stocks Forecasting Methodology** — independent balance sheet construction from NOPA, Census, inspections, NASS ethanol data. Divergence from consensus IS the trade.
- **ENSO/La Nina Weather Framework** — ONI to precipitation/temperature mapping, year-3 flip in multi-year events, 9-month CPC forecast lead
- **Acreage Report Biases** — corn above estimate 7/10 years, soybeans below 10 consecutive, plantings outside range 4/6 Junes
- **Chinese Put Framework** — need vs agreement distinction, USDA revision magnitude as demand signal
- **CDGO-RBD Spread** — refining margin adds $0.03-0.08/lb, understated by analysts using board oil only

## Three HB Report Formats Identified

1. **HB Weekly Text (2020-2022)** — essay format, one deep topic per week, most framework-rich
2. **HB Weekly Report (2025)** — structured multi-section, comprehensive, standardized
