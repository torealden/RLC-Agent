## Key Frameworks Extracted

### 1. Planting Pace → Acreage Prediction Model (BREAKTHROUGH)
Statistical model validated across 20+ years: when corn planting finishes early, corn acreage rises from March intentions (7/9 years since 2000, avg +911K acres). USDA hasn't lowered corn area when planting finishes on time or early since 2015. **Counterintuitive finding:** in 9 early-finish years, soybean area DECLINED avg 550K (fell 7/9 years). Market consistently misprices by using narrative rather than statistical relationships.

### 2. Acreage Allocation Rules of Thumb
Four structural rules markets repeatedly ignore: (1) Farmers prefer corn — even high fertilizer + record soy oil prices couldn't flip the relationship in 2022. (2) Late corn planting kills soy disproportionately — 2022 soy lost 2.63M acres from March, well below analyst range. (3) Technology effect — modern equipment means planting delays less impactful; prevent-plant thresholds must be more extreme. (4) Resurvey risk when states delayed — USDA resurveys in July, reports in August.

### 3. Quarterly Stocks Residual Use Model
Complete methodology for estimating quarterly stocks from known data streams plus residual estimation from export inspection comparisons. **Soybeans** cleanest: known demand + residual from inspections delta. **Corn** most complex: FSI (ethanol from EIA), feed (GCAUs), residual — with feed estimation error of 50-100M bu as main forecast error source. **Wheat** simplest: ending stocks = supply minus known demand.

### 4. June 30 Report Trading Framework
Most volatile trading day of the year. Two reports simultaneously create compounding surprises. Pre-position when own estimate diverges from consensus. When both acreage AND stocks surprise in same direction, move is amplified (2021: corn limit-up, soy +90¢). But macro can override fundamentals (2022: bullish soy acreage cut, price fell on recession fears).

### 5. North Dakota Late Planting Crop Switch
ND as bellwether for marginal-acre allocation. When planting delays close corn window, acres shift to soybeans and canola. 2022: corn 3.6M→3.2M, soy to record 7.4M, canola to record 1.89M. Connects canola CI advantage for biofuels (Batch 001) to US domestic production expansion.

### 6. RFS Compliance Cost Crisis (Jun 2021)
RINs at $2/gal → SCOTUS SRE ruling → 50+ pending applications → HB cut corn grind 250M bu. Three possible admin responses with historical precedents quantified. Biden ultimately denied all SREs (Batch 004), but 6-month uncertainty window demonstrated policy risk dominating fundamentals. Key insight: compliance deficit signals (Delta $350M) are leading indicators of political pressure.
