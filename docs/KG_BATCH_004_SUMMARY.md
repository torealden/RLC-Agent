## Key Frameworks Extracted

### 1. Soybean Oil Price Architecture (Dec 2021)
Renewable diesel expansion creates explicit, quantified price bands: biodiesel breakeven floor at 49c/lb futures, +10c with LCFS, RD breakeven 25c above that. Combined RD+biodiesel capacity (~5B gal) double the EPA mandate = guaranteed overcapacity driving feedstock competition. Below 1.5B lb soy oil stocks triggers non-biofuel usage cuts.

### 2. Initial Forecast Methodology (Dec 2020)
Systematic December methodology: carryout decline → price rally → acreage response. The 2020 forecast nailed the 2021 acreage battle (10.6M acre expansion). Key insight: even with massive soybean acreage expansion (+6.9M), carryout only reaches 144M bu (pipeline). Ethanol demand raising basis reduces export competitiveness — a self-limiting feedback loop.

### 3. Chinese Export Tracking Methodology (Nov 2020)
Multi-stream tracking: weekly commitments vs shipments, daily flash sales (>7 day gap = satiation), FOB spread seasonal pattern (US cheaper Sep-Jan, Brazil Feb-Aug), inventory draw analysis (how long can China wait). The need-vs-agreement distinction proved correct: Phase 1 status didn't determine buying, need did.

### 4. WASDE Report Analysis System (Nov 2021, Nov 2022)
Three-phase approach: pre-report (independent BS → divergence from consensus), report day (compare to both own AND consensus, calculate implied rest-of-world), post-report (historical revision patterns → next report forecast). Yield revision patterns create statistical edges: corn -0.7 bpa Nov→Jan, soy Oct-raise-then-Nov-cut only 3/20 years.

### 5. Brazil Crop Assessment Multi-Source Framework (Nov 2022)
IMEA (MT weekly) + Deral (PR weekly) + CONAB (monthly national). HB uses trendline yield, discounts CONAB early-season optimism. Brazil STU at 3.9% is half the US average — production miss has outsized price impact. Argentine UpRiver weakness → Brazil crush gains share (+8% in 2022).

## Cross-Linkages Strengthened

- **Soy oil architecture** connects directly to Batch 003 crush-for-oil thesis
- **Chinese tracking** reinforces Batch 003 Chinese put framework with granular methodology
- **Brazil crop** framework connects to Batch 002 Brazil → US displacement and Batch 003 ENSO weather
- **RFS mandate mechanics** complete the loop from Batch 001 RIN/SRE framework through biofuel policy to soybean oil demand
- **Acreage economics** connects to Batch 003 acreage report biases — market misprices because it doesn't use this methodology
