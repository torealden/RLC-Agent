  ## What Claude Desktop Should Provide

  To populate these tables, please have Claude Desktop summarize:

  ### For **agent_registry**:
  - All agents/scripts built (name, purpose, inputs, outputs, status)
  - Technologies/libraries used
  - Where they're stored (file paths)
  - What they integrate with

  ### For **data_sources_registry**:
  - All data sources connected or planned
  - APIs, files, scrapers configured
  - Credentials setup (location, not actual secrets)
  - Refresh rates and failure modes observed

  ### For **architecture_decisions**:
  - Key technical decisions made (database choices, API designs, model selections)
  - Why each choice was made
  - Alternatives that were considered

  ### For **Runbooks**:
  - Any documented processes or SOPs
  - How to run agents manually
  - Troubleshooting steps discovered
  - Deployment procedures

  ### For **lessons_learned**:
  - Bugs/issues encountered and fixed
  - Mistakes made and prevention rules
  - Best practices discovered

  ### For **master_timeline**:
  - Projects worked on and their status
  - Features planned but not yet built
  - Milestones reached

  ## Daily Sync Approach

  Once initial data is populated, for daily updates:
  1. I can query Notion for current state
  2. You provide new work done that day (via prompt or file)
  3. I update appropriate tables with new entries/status changes

  **Note:** Automated daily scheduling requires external tooling (cron job, Windows Task Scheduler, or similar) to
  trigger Claude Code at a specific time. Claude Code itself doesn't have built-in scheduling.
